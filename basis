<h1>Community Matters</h1>
<p>Have you ever felt alone in your experiences? What if i told you there are other people in the world who have had similar life experiences as you?</p>
<p>Finding Community, especially for black, indigenous, queer people of color can be super challenging. 'Concept-Name' was formed to provide everyone a chance on connection to a commmunity that listens, helps, and heals.</p>
